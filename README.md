# JavaScript-Debug-Deliverable
unfortunately i was only able to find one bug. within line two i noticed that Veribles  for the Let full_name set listed "first_name" twice. I then checked the generateFullName funtion on line 8 to confirmed i guess that like 2 wasnt correct. 

my javascrpt skills isnt not there yet to see the other bugs. After this deliverable i will run the script in a LLM to have a better understand of what i missed.
